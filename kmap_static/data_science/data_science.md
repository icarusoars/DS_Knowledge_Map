<span>Hi!</span> Welcome to Data Science Knowledge Map. Data Science has grown as a subject field to include many subfields. Data Science is so vast, that often times the trickiest part of learning Data Science is figuring out how to begin or what to put into your Data Science toolbox.

Hopefully with this website as a resource, you may be more intentional in learning Data Science. It wants to help you:
- figure out what to learn
- design a proper learning sequence
- understand the relation between knowledge areas
- choose several resources out of the sea of resources to learn

This website advocates a method of learning called **metalearning** or **building a knowledge map**. For more information on what this concept is, go to the **Motivation** page.

# Instructions
To unravel the knowledge areas of Data Science, click on one of the sub-circles. Each sub-circle represents a knowledge area of Data Science. This process can be continued as you arrive into the domain of any knowledge area.

When you click on a knowledge area, this information box here will display resources on learning this knowledge area.

# Resource Sections
Each resource will vary, but all of them will show several of these sections to help you understand this knowledge area quickly and in relation to others:
- Overview
- Importance
- Essential Concepts / Guiding Questions
- Strengths and Weaknesses
- Analogies
- Example usecases
- Resources to Perform In-Depth Learning

# A Few More Words
The aim of this resource is not to overwhelm you in any way. Data Science has evolved to encompass more and more knowledge areas because of how **purposefully vague** it is defined. The knowledge map shown aims to index as much Data Science knowledge as possible, but I don't believe the goal is to learn all the knowledge areas depicted. As always, choosing your trade-off between breadth and depth is one decision you'll have to make.

I also do not claim that this knowledge map is exhaustive. Despite designing it to the best of my ability and having interviewed much more knowledgeable people than me, it is impossible to index a knowledge field entirely. However, hopefully it follows the 80-20 rule whereby it captures 80% of the most important pieces of knowledge with 20% of our attention.

Without further ado, <span>Happy Learning!</span>
