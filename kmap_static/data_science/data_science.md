<span>Hi!</span> Thanks for visiting this website. This website is here to visualize the many different facets of Data Science, a term that many deem beautiful yet vague at the same time.

Hopefully with this website as a resource, you may be more intentional in learning Data Science. It wants to help you:
- figure out what to learn
- design a proper learning sequence
- understand the relation between knowledge areas
- choose several resources out of the sea of resources to learn

This website advocates a method of learning called **metalearning** or **building a knowledge map**. For more information on why this type of learning is beneficial, go to the **Motivation** page.

## This knowledge map is by no means complete or a full representation of the world of data science because:
- my knowledge is limited. This knowledge map will expand as I learn more about DS myself.
- DS is constantly expanding.

## There exists several painpoints in learning data science at the moment:
1. Data Science is vaguely defined. What is Data Science exactly? The question then follows how can I learn something before I even know what it is exactly?
2. Tutorials, articles are a dime a dozen out there. For example, Towards Data Science publication on medium has exploded in the number of articles it publishes now. For a beginner in Data Science, it is almost paralyzing to know which articles to read. What resources should I invest my time in? this Knowledge Map provides you with the resources that can help you quickly learn each knowledge area. It is opinionated, but its hope is to help you learn quicker and better.
3. What do I learn next? What should be the order I learn knowledge? Depending on what you want to be and what skills is required of one, one can learn differently and prioritize differently. For example, a ML engineer might prioritize depth in Machine Learning and Big Data whereas a Data Scientist might prioritize Statistics and experimental design. This knowledge map can help you better visualize the areas you should learn.
