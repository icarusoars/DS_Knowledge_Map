Statistics is the field that is closely tied to Data Science.
Whereas in machine learning courses, the emphasis is to develop accurate models, statistics courses emphasize controlling for covariates, controlling for bias, collecting data properly and other important nitty grittys. Statistical thinking helps ensure data is unbiased, models are as simple as possible but still explainable, and effects in the data are explained for and controlled for.
