Hi! If you are visiting this website, you are most likely learning Data Science, wanting to learn Data Science, or simply curious what all the fuss of Data Science is about.

This website is an attempt at visualizing the many different knowledge areas of Data Science. I was inspired to make this website after getting into Data Science myself and reading an [article](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/12/ultralearn-data-science-part1.html) on how Elon Musk acquires knowledge.

> "It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree — make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.” — Elon Musk

What Elon Musk is emphasizing here is that before we put on a pot of tea and sit down to learn in depth about a knowledge area, it is incredibly beneficial to first learn how this knowledge area relates to other knowledge areas. **Being able to see how pieces of knowledge connect and relate with each other is what makes us powerful as learners!** One of my favorite comics illustrates this idea visually:

This website is all about helping you learn what to learn, how to learn and how what you are learning relates. (Sorry for the tongue twister!) The article calls this act "metalearning". More colloquially, this is known as "seeing the big picture".

I started learning Data Science when I was a Junior in college. I was lucky to stumble upon the aforementioned article during my first semester of learning. Ever since then, beyond learning in depth Data Science knowledge areas through classes, online MOOCs, projects, I also made sure to read articles about knowledge areas I haven't learned. I may not necessarily have time to learn those knowledge areas in depth, but at least I understand on a high level their usefulness and relation to other knowledge areas. When I do come to learn that knowledge area, it'll be easier for me than starting to learn it cold.

If at this point, you are still unconvinced of the benefits of metalearning or drawing out a map of Data Science knowledge, here are some convincing arguments I've found in my 2 years of learning Data Science:
