<span>Hi!</span> If you are visiting this website, you are most likely learning Data Science, wanting to learn Data Science, or simply curious what all the fuss of Data Science is about.

This website is an attempt at visualizing the many different knowledge areas of Data Science. I was inspired to make this website after getting into Data Science myself and reading an [article](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/12/ultralearn-data-science-part1.html) on how Elon Musk acquires knowledge.

<blockquote>
It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree — make sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.

What Elon Musk is emphasizing here is that before we put on a pot of tea and sit down to learn in depth about a knowledge area, it is incredibly beneficial to first learn how this knowledge area relates to other knowledge areas. **Being able to see how pieces of knowledge connect and relate with each other is what makes us powerful as learners!** One of my favorite comics illustrates this idea visually:

This website is all about helping you learn what to learn, how to learn and how what you are learning relates. (Sorry for the tongue twister!) The article calls this act "metalearning". More colloquially, this might be known as "seeing the big picture".

I started learning Data Science when I was a Junior in college. I was lucky to stumble upon the aforementioned article during my first semester of learning. Ever since then, beyond learning Data Science knowledge areas in depth through classes, online MOOCs, projects, I also made sure to read articles about knowledge areas I haven't learned. I may not necessarily have time to learn those knowledge areas in depth, but at least I understand on a high level their usefulness and relation to other knowledge areas. When I do come to learn that knowledge area, it'll be easier for me than starting to learn it cold.

If at this point, you are still unconvinced of the benefits of metalearning or drawing out a map of Data Science knowledge, here are the most convincing arguments I've found in my years of learning Data Science:

## Figure Out What to Learn
Several peers have asked me, "how do I get started in Data Science?" The truth is, Data Science can seem overwhelming, because it really is. To be completely honest, the person who invented the term "Data Science" purposefully made it vague and seemingly vast! Here's an excerpt of an interview with the founder of the term of "Data Science", DJ Patil:

<blockquote>
Turns out when everybody applied to our job positions, they were most attracted to the ones we named "Data Scientist". The title sounds sophisticated and just vague enough to transcend industries and be taken seriously, even by people who have no idea what it is. The fundamental reason it has taken off is because people aren’t really sure what it means. And that’s the power. When you label yourself as something, people also label what you are not supposed to be. So, when you are in a room and say you’re a data analyst, they are going to think you are not supposed to be at these levels of meetings. But when you say you are the data scientist, they’ll be like, thank goodness we have the smart people here.

I think the takeaway is that Data Science is purposefuly vaguely defined and hence spans a vast sea of knowledge areas. Whereas a few years back Data Scientists were expected to be "unicorns" and know "everything", nowadays Data Science job positions are more specific and request a subset of the qualifications of being a unicorn.

Depending on the job qualifications, one may benefit from targeting their learning to the areas a job or research position requires. Drawing a knowledge map can help you figure out which areas you should prioritize tackling.


## Avoid Diminishing Marginal Returns
There are so many technologies out there. 

## Learn Faster
The order in which one learns can greatly improve learning speed.

For example, learning Probabilistic Graphical Models before having some grasp of probability knowledge will result in not-as-confident and slower learning. Learning Probabilistic Graphical Models right after one has learned probability and the concepts are fresh in mind would increase learning speed.

All the smartest people I've met in life have one thing in common: the ability to learn fast. I think being mindful in what sequence we learn knowledge areas can greatly increase our learning speed. Drawing out a knowledge map, we can see the dependences between knowledge areas and plan our learning sequence accordingly.

## Avoid Imposter Syndrome
Maintaining a knowledge map of Data Science can help you regularly check what you know already and what you want to learn.

At least for me, a lot of times whilst learning Data Science, I would find myself feeling that there is so much to learn in the finite time we have. On the good days, this feeling will motivate me to learn hungrily. On the bad days, this feeling will manifest itself into imposter syndrome - the feeling of not being good enough in a field of smart and incredibly capable people.

What I found is that visualizing my learning progress tackles imposter syndrome quite effectively. When I am consciously aware of how much I know, I feel better about myself and more confident.

Visualize your progress. Reward yourself for taking the initiative to learn hard topics!

If you've gotten here, hopefully I've convinced you that metalearning / drawing out a knowledge map is incredibly useful. I hope you adopt this so called method of metalearning too!

<span>Happy Learning!</span>
